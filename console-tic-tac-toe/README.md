# 🎮 C++ Console Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++ as part of my cpp-quest-2025 journey.

It allows players to play against each other, or against AI, directly from the console, featuring a clean and minimal design focused on core game logic.

## 🚀 Features

* Two-player mode (Player X vs Player O)
* Player-vs-AI mode (Player X vs AI O)
* Real-time board updates after each move
* Input validation to prevent invalid moves
* Automatic detection of wins, losses, and draws
* Simple and readable console interface
