# 📝 C++ Console To-Do List

This is a simple to-do list application written in C++ as part of my cpp-quest-2025 journey.

It allows users to manage tasks directly from the console with a clean and beginner-friendly design.

## 🚀 Features

* Add new tasks with a title, content, status, and priority
* Delete tasks from the list
* View all tasks in a structured format
* Console-based UI with simple navigation
